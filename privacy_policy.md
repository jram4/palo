# Privacy Policy for Palo – YouTube AI Chat Assistant

**Effective Date:** March 16, 2025  
**Last Updated:** March 16, 2025  

This Privacy Policy describes how Palo ("we", "our", "us") handles information collected through the Palo - YouTube AI Chat Assistant Chrome extension ("Extension"). By using the Extension, you consent to the practices outlined here.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Video Transcript and Metadata
When you use Palo’s AI features (video summarization, timeline, chatbot interactions), the full transcript of the YouTube video, along with metadata (video title, author, timestamps), is sent directly to Google's Gemini API. Palo does not independently store or retain this transcript.

- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### 1.2 User Questions
Your questions to Palo’s chatbot are sent to Google's Gemini API for processing. We do not store these questions beyond the current interaction.

### 1.3 Usage Analytics
Palo collects anonymous usage analytics via Google Analytics, including:
- Installation events
- Usage of AI prompts (chat, summaries)
- UI interactions (e.g., clicks, copying text)

This aggregated data helps us improve Palo and does not personally identify you.

### 1.4 Preferences and Local Storage
Palo saves user preferences such as themes, UI settings, daily usage quotas, and API keys locally in your Chrome profile using `chrome.storage.sync`. These settings may sync across your Chrome devices if synchronization is enabled.

### 1.5 API Key Storage
Palo provides a default API key for Gemini AI but strongly recommends using your own API key for improved privacy. If you provide your own API key, it will be securely stored within Chrome storage (`chrome.storage.sync`).

### 1.6 Subscription Information
For Palo+ subscriptions, we utilize ExtensionPay to manage subscription status and payments. We do not directly store or handle your financial information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We utilize the collected data exclusively to:
- Provide AI-generated features via Google’s Gemini API.
- Improve the user experience and Extension functionality.
- Enforce usage quotas and manage Palo+ subscriptions.
- Personalize your Extension settings and preferences.

---

## 3. Data Sharing
We share collected information with:
- **Google (Gemini API):** For generating AI responses.
- **Google Analytics:** To collect anonymous usage statistics.
- **ExtensionPay:** For subscription management (if subscribed).

We do **not** sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal data to third parties for unrelated purposes.

---

## 4. Your Privacy Choices
- **API Key:** You may provide your own Google Gemini API key to avoid using Palo’s shared key.
- **Disable Analytics:** Currently, analytics tracking is mandatory, but we plan to provide opt-out functionality soon.
- **Uninstall:** You may uninstall the Extension at any time, which will remove all locally stored data.

---

## 5. Security
Palo employs reasonable measures to secure your data within the Extension, although no internet-based service is entirely secure. Using a personal API key and careful management of your Chrome account enhances your privacy.

---

## 6. Children's Privacy
Palo is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children under this age.

---

## 7. Updates to Privacy Policy
We may update this policy periodically and will indicate any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date above. Regularly reviewing this policy is recommended.
